# VHDL Logic Gates Simulation with Xilinx Vivado

## Overview

This project marks my initial foray into digital design using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The objective was to design and simulate fundamental logic gates—AND, OR, NOT, and XOR—within a single VHDL program using Xilinx Vivado. Through this endeavor, I aimed to understand the basics of hardware description languages and the FPGA design workflow.

## VHDL Code Implementation

The VHDL code defines a single entity `basic_gates` with two inputs (`A` and `B`) and four outputs corresponding to the outputs of the AND, OR, XOR, and NOT gates.

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity basic_gates is
    Port ( A : in  STD_LOGIC;
           B : in  STD_LOGIC;
           AND_OUT : out  STD_LOGIC;
           OR_OUT  : out  STD_LOGIC;
           XOR_OUT : out  STD_LOGIC;
           NOT_A   : out  STD_LOGIC);
end basic_gates;

architecture Behavioral of basic_gates is
begin
    AND_OUT <= A AND B;
    OR_OUT  <= A OR B;
    XOR_OUT <= A XOR B;
    NOT_A   <= NOT A;
end Behavioral;
```

## Simulation in Xilinx Vivado

After writing the VHDL code, I utilized Xilinx Vivado to simulate the design. This involved creating a testbench to apply various input combinations and observing the corresponding outputs.

## Testbench Creation

The testbench applies all possible combinations of inputs `A` and `B` (00, 01, 10, 11) to the `basic_gates` entity and observes the outputs.

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity basic_gates_tb is
end basic_gates_tb;

architecture Behavioral of basic_gates_tb is
    signal A, B : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal AND_OUT, OR_OUT, XOR_OUT, NOT_A : STD_LOGIC;
    
begin
    uut: entity work.basic_gates
        port map (
            A => A, 
            B => B, 
            AND_OUT => AND_OUT, 
            OR_OUT => OR_OUT, 
            XOR_OUT => XOR_OUT, 
            NOT_A => NOT_A
        );

    process
    begin
        A <= '0'; B <= '0'; wait for 10 ns;
        A <= '0'; B <= '1'; wait for 10 ns;
        A <= '1'; B <= '0'; wait for 10 ns;
        A <= '1'; B <= '1'; wait for 10 ns;
        wait;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

## Waveform Analysis

The simulation results were visualized using Vivado’s waveform viewer, confirming the correct functionality of each gate.

| Input A | Input B | AND\_OUT | OR\_OUT | XOR\_OUT | NOT\_A |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0        | 0       | 0        | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 0        | 1       | 1        | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 0        | 1       | 1        | 0      |
| 1       | 1       | 1        | 1       | 0        | 0      |

## Challenges and Learnings

* **Code Structure**: Combining multiple gates into a single program required careful planning of the entity and architecture to ensure clean and readable code.
* **Testbench Design**: Creating a comprehensive testbench to validate all four gates simultaneously was a great exercise in understanding input-output relationships.
* **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing errors in the code (e.g., incorrect signal assignments or syntax errors) was a valuable learning experience.

## Tools and Resources

* **Xilinx Vivado**: Used for synthesis, simulation, and waveform analysis.
* **Online Tutorials and Documentation**: Invaluable for understanding VHDL basics and Vivado’s workflow.
