# 🔷 Half Adder using Structural Modelling in VHDL

🚀 Welcome to my VHDL journey! This project demonstrates the **design, simulation**, and **FPGA implementation** of a **Half Adder** using **structural modeling** in VHDL. The implementation is done in **Xilinx Vivado** and tested on the **Artix-7 Nexys A7-100T** FPGA board.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, simulate, and implement a **Half Adder** using VHDL on an FPGA.

A **Half Adder** is a simple combinational circuit that performs the addition of two binary bits. It has two outputs:

- **Sum (S)**
- **Carry (C)**

This project provides hands-on experience with **Hardware Description Languages (HDL)**, **combinational logic**, and **FPGA design flow**.

## 📚 Theory and Logic

### ➕ Boolean Expressions

- **Sum (S)** = A ⊕ B (XOR)
- **Carry (C)** = A · B (AND)

### 📊 Truth Table

| A | B | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
|---|---|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |     0     |
| 0 | 1 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 1 |    0    |     1     |

## 💡 VHDL Code Implementation

### 🧩 Top Module: `half_adder_structural.vhd`

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity half_adder_structural is
    port (A, B : in std_logic ;
          SUM, CARRY : out std_logic );
end half_adder_structural;

architecture Structural of half_adder_structural is
    component xor_gate 
        port (X, Y : in std_logic ;
              Z : out std_logic );
    end component ;
        
    component and_gate
        port (X, Y: in std_logic ;
              Z : out std_logic );
    end component ;

begin
    xor1: xor_gate port map (X => A, Y => B, Z => SUM);
    and1: and_gate port map (X => A, Y => B, Z => CARRY);
end Structural;
````

### 🔀 XOR Gate: `xor_gate.vhd`

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity xor_gate is
    Port (X, Y : in STD_LOGIC;
          Z : out STD_LOGIC);
end xor_gate;

architecture Behavioral of xor_gate is
begin
    Z <= X xor Y;
end Behavioral;
```

### ⛓ AND Gate: `and_gate.vhd`

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity and_gate is
    port (X, Y: in std_logic ;
          Z : out std_logic );
end and_gate;

architecture Behavioral of and_gate is
begin
    Z <= X and Y;
end Behavioral;
```

## 🧪 Simulation in Xilinx Vivado

### 🧪 Testbench Creation

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity tb_half_adder is
end tb_half_adder;

architecture test of tb_half_adder is
    signal A, B, SUM, CARRY: std_logic;

    component half_adder_structural 
        port (A, B : in std_logic ;
              SUM, CARRY : out std_logic );
    end component ;

begin
    uut: half_adder_structural port map (A => A, B => B, SUM => SUM, CARRY => CARRY);

    process 
    begin
        A <= '0'; B <= '0'; wait for 20ns;
        A <= '0'; B <= '1'; wait for 20ns;
        A <= '1'; B <= '0'; wait for 20ns;
        A <= '1'; B <= '1'; wait for 20ns;
        wait;
    end process;
end test;
```

## 📈 Waveform Analysis

The simulation output confirms the correct operation of the Half Adder:

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
| - | - | --- | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 1     |
